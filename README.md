LetMeIn is a ShinyApp that allows prospective students who want to apply to statistics graduate programs make better and faster decisions about where to apply based on their GPA, GRE scores and citizenship status. Students first select a school they are interested in, and LetMeIn calculates the average scores for accepted, rejected and waitlisted students and compares them to the student's scores. By seeing how their scores stack up, students can quickly determine whether they should apply to their selected school. All estimates are based on entries from thegradcafe.com, a public forum where graduate school applicants share their admissions information and whether they got accepted, rejected or waitlisted.
